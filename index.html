            <p>As one of the fastest growing business models, the Sharing Economy has swept the world and restructured the market for the past decade. While this emerging model has offered much flexibility in working hours, taxi drivers, who have always been one of the most economically vulnerable groups in Taiwan, are struggling to make ends meet under the out-of-date laws, and COVID-19 might be the last straw.</p>
            <p>
                Uber first came to Taiwan as a “Digital Information Supply Services” in April 2013, bringing the new business model, the so-called “Sharing Economy”, to the taxi industry in Taiwan. With its more convenient and transparent way to book a ride, Uber hit the big time and poses a threat to the traditional taxi industry. </p>
            <p>
                “I was a salesman then, and I had lots of spare time. So I thought ‘why not earn some extra cash at odd hours by driving Uber?’ ” Will Lee, the spokesman of Taiwan Internet-Platform Hired Drivers Organization said. He has been an Uber driver since four years ago and now this has become his full-time job. “It is pretty easy for anyone to start because all you need is a car. Creating the new business model, Uber makes it possible to turn people’s spare time into money and helps match passengers and drivers on its app platform. Everything becomes more transparent than ever, and that's why people love it.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="h3">Uber stays in Taiwan under a controversial new transportation law,which is said to be a compromise by the government</p>
            <br>
            <p>While Uber always provided a clear, and sometimes more competitive price using its own fare estimator, the traditional taxi in Taiwan was restricted by the transportation law, which calculates the fee by a calculator configured to the car under a fixed rate. This provoked the protest of the traditional taxi drivers who were resentful about the unfair competition: Uber drivers vied with them for a market share but were free from the restrictions of the law.</p>
            <p>
                To settle the controversy, the Ministry of Transportation amended the law "Regulations on the Administration of Automobile Transportation" after the discussion with Uber. The amendment took effect in December 2019 and transformed Uber from an oversea E-commerce operator into a domestic company.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the amendment, Uber has to pay business tax to the Taiwan government and cooperate with local taxi companies in order to continue its operation in Taiwan. One the other hand, its passengers are exempted from handling fees for credit card transactions because it is no longer an oversea company.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="h3">Overall worse-off business for both Uber and traditional taxi drivers under the new amendment
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>“Uber has lost its edge, and no one is better off.” Will Lee said that although the fee they can earn grew by 20% with the restricted price rate under the newly amended law, the overall business is worse. “Taxis are just a lot more expensive than public transportations. People like students might decide to take Uber sometimes because it used to be cheaper than traditional taxis, but now they are all back to the MRT or bus. The market itself shrinks.”</p>
            <p>
                “What’s more, we have to pay for both Uber and taxi companies.” Will Lee said with a resigned sigh. In Taiwan, the taxi system works through a special medium called “taxi company” which dates back to around 50 years ago. Back then, most people weren't able to afford self-owned cars to work as taxi drivers, so people had to rent cars from the well-off who ran taxi companies and were required to pay a fixed portion of their profits to taxi companies. </p>
            <p>
                To better manage and boost the taxi industry, the government has regulated all taxi drivers to be listed and subordinated to taxi companies until now. In an era where almost everyone owns a car, this regulation contradicts the spirit of “Sharing Economy” and becomes the stumbling stone. “For every 100 dollars I earned , I had to pay 25 dollars to Uber. Now I have to pay another 5% of it and 1500 dollars per month to the taxi company even when I don't work for anyone in the taxi company. I work for myself. The law is just out-of-date.” </p>
            <p>
                “This is a repeated issue in Taiwan,” said Kuan-Yu Lin, the Chief Director of Science & Technology Law Institute, Institute for Information Industry. “We always forget to make a long-term plan when fixating on solving current problems. Making piecemeal touch ups serves no purpose and the system might collapse in the end. The policy’s core value fails to ensure sustainability, but it’s of course related to the rivalry between political parties in Taiwan.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="h3">Taxi drivers are still excluded from the main benefits of labor laws</p>
            <br>

            <p>Months after Will Lee started driving Uber many years ago, he decided to buy 20 million-NT-dollars Passenger Insurance for the sake of passenger safety. In Taiwan, both Uber drivers and traditional taxi drivers are not protected by the main labor law, Labor Standards Act, because they’re considered to be “contractors” rather than ”employees”.</p>
            <p>
                Taxi drivers can only apply for labor insurance in the Taxi Driver Occupation Union, and pay a higher insurance fee than the usual employees. In addition, these taxi drivers are not granted other benefits such as pension and unemployment compensation. </p>
            <p>
                Besides the basic "Mandatory Automobile Liability Insurance" every car owner has to buy, Uber drivers are regulated with another Passenger Insurance under the new amendment. However, the Passenger Insurance can’t be applied when it’s not in operation. That’s to say, as long as the car accident takes place with no passengers in the vehicle, the Passenger Insurance can not be applied even if the driver is on his or her way to pick up passengers.</p>
            <p>
                The taxi companies are jointly liable when car accidents happen to traditional taxi drivers. By contrast, Uber, considering itself as an independent medium, claims that it doesn't take any responsibility when accidents occur.</p>
            <p>
                ”When it comes to the third-party liability insurance, the contract and its calculation of benefits are actually different between commercial-use and self-use cars,” said Director Lin. ”Passengers may meet with car accidents or attacks when taking Uber, and when these things happen, no driver is able to afford the compensation even with insurance. That’s why we can’t ignore the need of adding mandatory insurance when the public policy is designed.”</p>
            <p>
                “Drivers or the internet platforms are not allowed to decide whether they want to have it or not in the regulation. It’s just necessary to build the bulwark in the institution to decrease the risk.” Kuan-Yu Lin believes that the mandatory insurances regulated by the current law are apparently not enough for the drivers to afford a huge amount of compensation when having car accidents. At present, Uber drivers can only seek other insurances to fend for themselves.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="h3">Hit hard by COVID-19</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although the government offered some relief subsidies and opportunities for drivers to deliver essential needs for battling the virus , the income is insufficient for them to make ends meet.</p>
            <p>
                According to the statistics published by the Ministry of Transportation, the average income of taxi drivers is 45568 NT dollars, and the average necessary cost such as the fuel fee, parking fee, and the insurance is 19985 NT dollars, which accounts for around 44% of their incomes. These numbers suggested that taxi drivers’ income structure is highly unstable, and the remaining profit is only 2000 dollars higher than the legal minimum wage (23100 NT dollars), not to mention those whose income is below the average.</p>
            <p>
                During the lockdown period, their income dropped drastically. ”Without visitors, at least 50% of the business is gone. There are less local passengers but a decreasing number of foreign visitors puts us in dire straits because they are the ones who usually book long-distance rides.” Will Lee told us when the first wave of the pandemic hit in the spring of 2020. Now as local cases spike in Taiwan and with most people staying or working from home during the Level 3 epidemic alert, taxi drivers are desperately struggling to stay alive. </p>
            <p>
                Not only did the new amendment of the transportation law forced Uber drivers to compete with the traditional taxi drivers under the same fixed-rate price and deprived them of their most competitive advantages(the more flexible and lower price), but it also failed to improve the labor rights and employment benefits of taxi drivers. Labor welfare for taxi drivers matters so much that it should be considered the most pressing issue to be fixed because the impact is more than detailed contracts between drivers and Uber — it plays an influential role pertaining to the safety of passengers. </p>
            <p>
                While the emergence of Uber boosted the overall improvement of Taiwan’s taxi industry and successfully promoted the application of E-commerce and cashless payment, striking a balance between the free-trade market and labor rights in the ever-improving technological generation remains a crucial and urgent problem.
